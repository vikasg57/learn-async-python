# Exercise 1: Coffee Shop Simulator ‚òï

## Difficulty: Beginner

## Learning Objectives
- Practice basic `async`/`await` syntax
- Use `asyncio.gather()` for concurrent execution
- Understand time measurement in async programs

## Problem Statement
You are building a coffee shop simulation where multiple baristas can prepare different drinks simultaneously. Each drink takes a different amount of time to prepare.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Create three async functions:
   - `make_espresso()`: Takes 3 seconds to prepare
   - `make_latte()`: Takes 5 seconds to prepare
   - `make_cappuccino()`: Takes 4 seconds to prepare

2. Each function should:
   - Print when it starts making the drink
   - Simulate preparation time using `asyncio.sleep()`
   - Print when the drink is ready
   - Return the drink name

3. Create a main function `coffee_shop()` that:
   - Starts all three drink preparations simultaneously
   - Waits for all drinks to be ready
   - Prints the total time taken

### Expected Output
```
Starting to make Espresso...
Starting to make Latte...
Starting to make Cappuccino...
Espresso is ready!
Cappuccino is ready!
Latte is ready!
All drinks prepared in 5.0 seconds
```

### Constraints
- All drinks must be prepared concurrently (not sequentially)
- Total time should be approximately 5 seconds (the longest drink time)
- Use `asyncio.gather()` for concurrent execution

## Hints
- Use `time.time()` to measure total execution time
- Remember to `await` async functions
- `asyncio.gather()` can run multiple coroutines concurrently

## Bonus Challenges
1. Add random preparation times (2-6 seconds per drink)
2. Add a customer name parameter to each drink
3. Implement a queue system for multiple orders

## What You'll Learn
- How async functions can run concurrently
- The difference between sequential and parallel execution
- Basic usage of `asyncio.gather()`
```

**File:** `02-exercises/exercise2_website_checker/problem.md`

```markdown
# Exercise 2: Website Status Checker üåê

## Difficulty: Beginner-Intermediate

## Learning Objectives
- Practice async loops
- Implement error handling
- Work with random delays and results
- Process multiple async operations

## Problem Statement
Create a website monitoring system that checks multiple websites' status simultaneously. The checker should simulate network delays and random failures.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Create an async function `check_website(url)`:
   - Print "Checking {url}..."
   - Simulate network delay (random 1-3 seconds)
   - Return True (80% probability) or False (20% probability)
   - Print "‚úÖ {url} is online" or "‚ùå {url} is offline"

2. Create main function `monitor_websites()`:
   - Check 5 websites simultaneously
   - Count online vs offline sites
   - Print summary statistics

### Website List
```python
websites = [
    "google.com",
    "github.com", 
    "stackoverflow.com",
    "python.org",
    "asyncio-docs.com"
]
```

### Expected Output Format
```
Checking google.com...
Checking github.com...
Checking stackoverflow.com...
Checking python.org...
Checking asyncio-docs.com...
‚úÖ github.com is online
‚úÖ google.com is online
‚ùå stackoverflow.com is offline
‚úÖ python.org is online
‚úÖ asyncio-docs.com is online

=== Website Status Report ===
Online: 4/5
Offline: 1/5
Response time: 2.3 seconds
```

## Hints
- Use `random.uniform(1, 3)` for delays
- Use `random.random() < 0.8` for 80% probability
- Store results as tuples: (url, status)
- Use `asyncio.gather()` with return values

## Bonus Challenges
1. Add retry logic for failed checks
2. Implement timeout handling
3. Add response time per website
4. Create a continuous monitoring loop

## What You'll Learn
- Handling multiple async operations
- Working with random delays
- Collecting and processing async results
- Basic error simulation

# Exercise 3: Download Manager üì•

## Difficulty: Intermediate

## Learning Objectives
- Compare sequential vs parallel execution
- Show progress for async operations
- Calculate performance improvements
- Work with different file sizes

## Problem Statement
Build a download manager that can download files either sequentially (one after another) or in parallel (all at once). Compare the performance difference.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Create `download_file(filename, size_mb)`:
   - Calculate download time: 100MB = 1 second
   - Show progress: "Downloading {filename} ({size_mb}MB)..."

   - Return tuple: (filename, size_mb, time_taken)

2. Implement `sequential_download(files)`:
   - Download files one by one
   - Show total progress
   - Return total time

3. Implement `parallel_download(files)`:
   - Download all files simultaneously
   - Show individual progress
   - Return total time

### Test Data
```python
files = [
    ("movie.mp4", 500),      # 5 seconds
    ("music.mp3", 50),       # 0.5 seconds
    ("document.pdf", 10),    # 0.1 seconds
    ("image.jpg", 5),        # 0.05 seconds
    ("archive.zip", 300)     # 3 seconds
]
```

### Expected Output
```

## Learning Objectives
- Implement priority-based execution
- Use `asyncio.create_task()`
- Manage task batches
- Track detailed execution metrics

## Problem Statement
Build a task scheduler that processes tasks based on priority levels. High-priority tasks should complete before low-priority tasks begin.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Task Structure:
   - Task ID (e.g., "HIGH-1", "LOW-1")
   - Duration (seconds)
   - Priority ("high" or "low")

2. Processing Rules:
   - All high-priority tasks run simultaneously
   - Low-priority tasks start only after high-priority complete
   - Track individual task times
   - Show real-time progress

3. Metrics:
   - Total execution time
   - Average time per priority level
   - Task completion order

### Test Data
```python
# High priority: 3 tasks, 1-2 seconds each
high_priority_tasks = [
    ("HIGH-1", 1.5, "high"),
    ("HIGH-2", 1.8, "high"),
    ("HIGH-3", 1.2, "high")
]

# Low priority: 5 tasks, 2-4 seconds each
low_priority_tasks = [
    ("LOW-1", 2.5, "low"),
    ("LOW-2", 3.0, "low"),
    ("LOW-3", 2.2, "low"),
    ("LOW-4", 3.5, "low"),
    ("LOW-5", 2.8, "low")
]
```

### Expected Output
```
